This project for Achievement 1 was to create a simple javascipt application for a Pokedex.

The application was to include the original 150 pokemon in an organized and responsive app that would allow a user click on an individual pokemon name and view brief desription and image of that Pokemon.

The project used HTML, CSS, Javasctipt, Bootstrap, Eslint and Prettier.
